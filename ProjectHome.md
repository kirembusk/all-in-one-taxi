This is an all in one taxi cab application.  This application is designed for both taxi riders and taxi drivers.  The taxi riders can use this application to calculate the cost of the taxi journey before he/she begins the ride.  The taxi riders can also find available taxi cab company in their nearby areas with the help of the GPS tracking device on the mobile device.  The taxi riders can book an available taxi that they can find, and the taxi drivers can choose to accept or refuse the taxi ride booking. The taxi riders will get an SMS notification alert when the cab is on its way or when it arrive at the destination.

The app also includes a ride share feature. It could be random drivers that wanted to go from destination A to a destination B and that driver wanted to split the gas with the other person. Let's say I am driving to Market street to go to work and I happen to find somebody around the neighborhood that is going to downtown too. So I contact the other person and ask them if he/she might want a ride there too and they will split the gas.
